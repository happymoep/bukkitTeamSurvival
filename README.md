# bukkitTeamSurvival


What?
-----

This is a plugin for the [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) server.

It creates a world with fixed border and teams of two players each.

The world is deleted afterwards to ensure that you always get new terrain, ores, animals and chances to win :wink:
