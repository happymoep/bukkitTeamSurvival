# bukkitTeamSurvival


What?
-----

This is a plugin for the [Minecraft]("http://minecraft.net") [Bukkit]("http://bukkit.org") server.

It creates a world with fixed border and teams of two players each.

The world is deleted afterwards to ensure that you always get new terrain, ores, animals and chances to win :wink:
